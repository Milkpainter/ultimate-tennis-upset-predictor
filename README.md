# 🎾 Ultimate Tennis Upset Predictor

> The most advanced tennis prediction system designed to detect market inefficiencies and predict upsets using machine learning, advanced Elo ratings, and statistical arbitrage principles.

## 🏆 System Overview

This system combines cutting-edge machine learning techniques with deep tennis analytics to identify betting opportunities where the market undervalues underdogs. Built after analyzing top GitHub tennis prediction repositories, this system integrates the best methodologies from projects like Tennis Crystal Ball, Bet-on-Sibyl, and advanced statistical arbitrage models.

### 🎯 Key Achievements
- **Target Accuracy**: >68% overall, >75% upset detection
- **ROI Target**: >15% annual returns
- **Sharpe Ratio**: >2.0 risk-adjusted returns
- **Market Edge**: Identifies mispriced matches with >20% inefficiency

## 🚀 Core Features

### 📊 Advanced Elo Rating System
- **Surface-specific ratings** (Hard, Clay, Grass)
- **Dynamic K-factors** based on player experience and recent activity
- **Tournament importance weighting** (Grand Slams get 1.4x multiplier)
- **Fatigue modeling** and surface transition penalties
- **Set-based dominance adjustments**

### 🔧 Sophisticated Feature Engineering
- **Recent Form Momentum**: Time-decayed performance with quality opponent weighting
- **Pressure Performance Index**: Big match and clutch situation analysis
- **Surface Adaptation Score**: Transition efficiency between surfaces
- **Fatigue Accumulation**: Tournament load and rest recovery modeling
- **H2H Psychological Factor**: Head-to-head dominance patterns
- **Market Overreaction Detection**: Betting volume and line movement analysis

### 🤖 Multi-Model ML Ensemble
- **Gradient Boosting** (35% weight): Pattern recognition in complex interactions
- **Random Forest** (25% weight): Feature importance and robustness
- **Logistic Regression** (25% weight): Interpretable baseline predictions
- **Support Vector Machine** (15% weight): Non-linear pattern detection

### 💰 Statistical Arbitrage Engine
- **Kelly Criterion** position sizing for optimal bankroll management
- **Expected Value** calculations across multiple bookmakers
- **Market Inefficiency** detection with confidence intervals
- **Value Betting** alerts for high-probability opportunities

## 🎯 Upset Detection Strategies

### Core Upset Indicators
1. **Service Game Dominance Ratio** - Superior break point conversion
2. **Recent Form Momentum Shift** - Hot underdogs vs cold favorites  
3. **Fatigue Differential** - Fresh players vs tired stars
4. **Surface Specialization Gap** - Tactical advantages on specific surfaces
5. **Pressure Performance** - Big match experience and clutch factor
6. **Market Overreaction** - Public betting creating value opportunities

### Market-Beating Approaches
- **Contrarian Betting**: Fade public overreactions to big names
- **Surface Transitions**: Exploit adaptation difficulties
- **Early Round Value**: Target motivated underdogs vs coasting favorites
- **Weather/Conditions**: Indoor/outdoor and wind advantages
- **Injury Comebacks**: Players returning from extended breaks
- **Line Movement Analysis**: Detect sharp money vs public betting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Milkpainter/ultimate-tennis-upset-predictor.git
cd ultimate-tennis-upset-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.ensemble_predictor import TennisUpsetPredictor
from src.feature_engineer import TennisFeatureEngineer
from src.elo_system import AdvancedTennisElo

# Initialize systems
predictor = TennisUpsetPredictor()
feature_engine = TennisFeatureEngineer()
elo_system = AdvancedTennisElo()

# Load and prepare data
features = feature_engine.generate_comprehensive_features(
    player_a_data, player_b_data, match_context
)

# Get prediction
result = predictor.predict_upset_probability(features)
print(f"Upset Probability: {result['ensemble_upset_probability']:.1%}")

# Calculate betting value
betting_value = predictor.calculate_betting_value(
    result['ensemble_upset_probability'], 
    market_odds
)
print(f"Expected Value: {betting_value['underdog_expected_value']:+.1f}%")
```

### Live Prediction Example
```python
# Real match prediction
match_features = {
    'elo_gap': -100.0,           # Underdog by 100 Elo points
    'momentum_differential': 0.35, # Underdog has better recent form
    'fatigue_differential': 0.6,   # Favorite is more tired
    'market_overreaction_score': 0.25 # Public overreacting to favorite
    # ... other features
}

prediction = predictor.predict_upset_probability(match_features)
if prediction['ensemble_upset_probability'] > 0.35:
    print("🚨 UPSET ALERT: High value opportunity detected!")
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Integration**: Live match probability updates
- **Mobile Alerts**: Push notifications for high-value opportunities
- **Multi-Sport Expansion**: Adapt framework for other sports
